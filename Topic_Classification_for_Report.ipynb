strictly implemented it could be unlucky sometimes but if you think it should be counted as a goal because it was close the rules will cease to exist and everyone should just play with common sense like street football', 'what i think needs to happen is a review of the rule', 'the rule was not put in place long ago to call offsides like this', 'offside by a toe doesnt impact the reason why the rule was put in place', 'but until that happens then we play and live by what it is', 'my thought is that this situation shows that the offside rule should change to be more intuitive', 'the idea of the rule is to discourage cherry picking and spread play too far but i think the current way the rule is designed is too punishing and restrictive', 'this isnt even a novel thought many big names in the game have for years said this including arsene wenger', 'either we make it any part of the body can keep a player onside so in this case the defenders hand would have counted or we change it in some other way to allow for more attacking play where some part of the upper body of the attacking player can be offside so long as their feet are onside or both', 'i also think generally we should be relying more on tech to call them exclusively', 'its technically offside but in the past this was called same height', 'still playing the ball with the hand i think it was inigo that is clearly a free kick for hakan', 'it is not possible to pinpoint the moment a ball is played to a degree of accuracy that allows an offside that narrow to be called', 'in this case i believe the officials on the pitch called it offside so var were merely confirming the decision but a toenail offside is simply too narrow a call for that technology to accurately make', 'anyone who has kicked a ball will know the difference between contact and release of a toe poke side footer laces shot or volley', 'it was called offside on the pitch before var got involved too', 'nor did the ref look at the var footage meaning that everyone was confident that it was clearly offside', 'i get that being offside by literal centimeters is frustrating but its not like it just happens to inter or just in the champions league', 'barca had a disallowed lewy goal against real sociedad iirc that was literally offside by a tip of the boot', 'we complained but that never changed the outcome of the match', 'yeah', 'people always gonna complain even with stone cold evidence', 'as a barca fan even after the replays i thought it was a goal 100', 'it honestly doesnt feel good knowing that we were saved by mere inches  milliseconds', 'mkhitaryan and inter punished because his stride was different than the barca defender so they are denied a pretty clear cut goal from the naked eye and prevar rulings', 'offside rule

is released', 'its not a robbery', 'i agree with you but in the grand scheme of things being 1 in offside is not really going to affect the overall play', 'if you support fenerbahce one millisecond to the left', 'if you support galatasaray one millisecond to the right\\n\\n jose mourinho', 'when the same thing happened to lewandowski in la liga nobody was complaining about it', 'i think its more crazy that the linesman actually said it was offside while it was never visible with the naked eye', 'ultimately the issue is that the offside rule was never meant to be applied this exactly', 'when it was made i doubt the rule writers whoever invented it lol anticipated the level of analysis that would go into decisions with the advent of modern technology', 'makes it hard to enjoy the game when every goal is disallowed', 'enjoy the corporate  robotic game', 'it isnt robbery but games gone when having 25 cm decide a game  football isnt a sport like archery or 100m sprint', 'i get that technically its the correct call but when its that tight making the call just doesnt feel right', 'my problem is how fucking fast did they decide that cm decision', 'there were other situations much easier to decide than this and it took like 3 minutes', 'definitely you wouldnt be saying it if it was a barca goal disallowed', 'this kind of like the double touch penalties', 'get fucked inter  sorry', 'its like the alvarez pen people want justice insofar as it benefits their favored outcome', 'live during the game and in the instant replay it didnt look like offside at all', 'just like the alvarez penalty except this situation wasnt as important as a penalty shootout', 'his toe was offside', 'surely theres got to be some margin where its like ok thats such a minor part of you to be offside that itll be overruled', 'so youre telling me the lines man across the field saw mikitarian  toe offsides youre supposed to hold off unless its clear', 'the argument is you cant perfectly determine when the ball leaves the foot therefore you cant perfectly determine the offside therefore the benefit of the doubt should go to the attacker', 'it was technically offside but also a little unfair', 'the rule as it stands is shit and needs to reviewed to create one that makes sense in the world of var', 'we dont know the real frame of that offside photo and when the pass was maybe if it was 05 seconds before or after it would not be offside', 'ueflona getting ghost fouls and flopping all over the place to get a call', 'i get it vini does it but damn an entire club to do it', 'inter fans were the most vocal supporters of var for decades before its actual adoption', 'back when inter was winning once in a blue moon and according to the fans the referees were in juventus andor milans pocket onfield review was every inter fans wet dream and the only way to make football clean again', 'now enjoy it and its bitter fruit', 'the same offside potentially cost barca 3 points in the league as they lost the game when barca couldve been 10 up', 'yall literally cry when madrid plays about fouls or penalties or var any game now you see it how things work i guess', 'shouldnt surprise you that most people are not smart since the trump incident', 'what most people dont realize is there will be some variance or tolerance in the final snapshots', 'show me how precise it is', 'the truth is the decision can be manipulated either way and it isnt clear cut i dont see it as an obvious offside', 'could go either way usually those decisions dont get called when it isnt certain', 'i dont care about the decision but offsides should be obvious even at extremes of the variance', 'even mykhtarian himself admitted it\\n\\nidk why is this a big deal', 'still whining about lewandowskis toenail being offside like it was some unsolved war crime', 'funny how yall act like its the only time in football history a tight offside decision ever happened', 'same thing', 'so by that logic inter fans should be writing essays and crying in press conferences too right', 'great', 'go complain to ifab or comet system devs and ask them to rewrite football just to fit your feelings', 'spoiler alert theyll laugh close the door and tell you to get back on reddit and keep farming sympathy with another salty meme post', 'i feel like there should be an offset to the offside rule that allows for a 1 inch offside allowance', 'it accounts for differences in shoe size and body shape', 'i do believe that the border should be somewhere regarding onside and offside', 'however i believe we should not cut out interpretation of the situation at all during moments where something needs to be checked talking about moments where even it is hard to see with the system when a ball was hit because a milliseconds can make a difference if it was onsideoffside', 'but maybe you are right about not giving the benefit of the doubt to the attacker during uncertainty', 'except for the fact they didnt use the right frame', 'no it wasnt', 'typical barca fan', 'goals like this getting disallowed is not good for anybody whether youre ready to admit it or not', 'if after this match any barca fans still call madrid as a cheater then it would be ironic', 'the ref helped barca with another draw i mean if it was madrid then imagine the outrage in all of the football subs just cause it was barca everyones lip tight', 'it was the narrowest margin but ref uefa wants barca to win the ucl this season', 'no one is questioning whether it technically was or wasnt offside', 'people are

that barca had a great season adds salt to the injury', 'at the end of the day its only one season in the big scheme of things and he got us this far despite the many injuries and lack of signings so lets not blow it out of proportion', 'number 1', 'to say nothing of earlier seasons no other coach couldve won the 2022 and 2024 ucl campaigns with those madrid teams', 'transitions and loads of injuries could only be solved by a serious level of creativity that no manager adhering to a strict system couldve solved', 'the way he took promising players and found where they worked best used bellingham last season and got the teams to work so well despite gaps was nothing short of genius', 'it eventually became too disjointed but that it took this long is an unbelievable achievement', 'a pity he didnt win with bayern', 'the best', 'number one by far', 'his achievements in the competition just cant be rivalled imo', 'another record of his is that hes the only coach to have coached in 6 finals', 'ancelotti isnt just arguably the greatest cl coach of all time hes easily in the conversation for being one of the greatest coaches of all time period', 'not to hard to think \\n\\nhe won 5 he is no 1 simple \\n\\nmaybe if pep in future wins 5 he can overtake', 'number fucking one  that bum ass madrid team made him look so bad  not always the coaches fault', 'one of the greatest managers of all time maybe even the best the disrespect he has received this season is a shame yes madrid need a change for next season and xabi is the man for the job but that doesnt change the fact that ancelotti is one of the greats', 'he ranks as the greatest coach in champions league history', 'as an arsenal fan i can confidently say 1 hes the goat manager in the cl', 'overall pep is probably better but in the cl ancelotti is something g else', 'that went on to win 3 ucl in a row in the future', 'hes only 65 he could always come back to europe in a few years', 'why is it most likely he will never coach in the cl again', 'no manager has won the comp more times than he has he won at different eras as well so hes the number 1 for me', 'number 1 for sure with 7 ucl it might be an unbeatable record', 'he is right up there', 'he did however benefit a lot from the work mourinho did at madrid', 'easily top 1 in ucl', 'the fact this guy went to everton and had them cooking makes him the goat', 'hes probably the best in the champions league i will begrudgingly accept that but stop this nonsense about him being the best football coach ever', 'he won 1 league title in 9 years with one of the most stacked ac milan teams of all time', 'as a barca fan i believe that he is a ucl legend at the top of the list', 'brazil can still qualify', 'ancelotti has won 10 of all european cupchampions league finals 7 of 69 and 20 of all champions league finals this millennium 5 of 24', 'hes won more champions leagues as a player and manager 7 than all clubs except for real madrid and milan', 'i can understand having doubts about his standing in the general rankings of a coach pep saf mourinho etc were revolutionary in their style of play', 'they bent the world of football to their will at their peaks and forced everyone else to adapt or die', 'with all that said there is absolutely no way to claim that ancelotti isnt the certified nr1 best coach in the ucl', 'hes won it 5 times in different eras yeah hes arguably a sub par league manager but for the all time ucl 11 hes the manager', 'yall keep on tryna shoehorn pep into this convo when ancelotti is miles ahead', 'easily 1', 'i hate that all these posts remind me that hes going to leave', 'i thank the man for everything and wish him all the best with his new adventure', 'cl he is number 1 only really zidane in cl rivals him and you could argue he laid the foundation for ancelotti success there in league its another story sure he won a lot of titles but his football doesnt work well in league formats compared to cup formats', 'period', '2005 is fucking crazy tho', 'why won the coach again in the competition', 'i could quite easily see him coaching brazil until the world cup and then leaving for a premier league team', 'number 1', 'he most probably will coach in the ucl again\\n\\nbut hes definitely up there as one of the best for sure maybe just pipped to number 1 by zidane because hes coached a lot more seasons than he has', 'think its worth pointing out that qualification is a lot easier than in is paisleys day where only league winners qualified', 'sure that means you dont get the atleticos of that time but means he got less chances to win it and only beat the best', 'even if he coaches brazil he still can one day manage another team', '1', 'champions league era\\n\\ncarlo zizou pep mourinho delbosque ferguson heynckes hitzfeld then everyone else', 'honorable mentions\\n\\nhector cuper lippi van gaal klopp benitez goethals inzagui enrique\\n\\nbasically my criteria is to do it play the final more than once', 'all i can say is theres a reason ancelotti didnt do great at everton', 'winning it as a player has no merit on the discussion as a great coach so that point is moot', 'he is the best', 'theres zero doubt about it', 'in no particular order\\n\\ncruyff guardiola ancelotti  zidane ferguson', 'after that i would have klopp del bosque arsene wenger mourinho bielsa etc', 'in the competition number 1\\n\\nin football history top 3 with pep and sir alex', 'his milan side in the 00s was the most entertaining side that i have ever had the pleasure of watching', 'because of what he did in milan both as a player and a coach he ranks in my all time number one', 'number 1 the man knows how to win a high stakes knock out tournament', 'the biggest question is how did everton managed to hire this guy lol but yeah personally he is tied with cruyff in no2 of all time for me  i remember the time he came to england for the very first time and won the pl with chelsea it was awesome', '', 'beyond any stats and number of finals or semi finals played no one wants to play ancelottis teams', 'no one wanted to play real mid 2010s', 'and people may have fancied their chances against early 2020s real but there was a sense of inevitability with them', 'the 20162017 remains a big what if to me bayern were hard robbed that game', 'honourable mentions to klopp who played in 4 finals w1 l3 with two different teams', 'i want to give kudos to tuchel he did reach 2 finals with unfancied clubs at the time winning 1 he also seems to reach at least the qf stage bar 1 season', 'other managers then had 45  years bursts of being a constant threat and reaching multiple finals like allegris juve 0w 2 l benitez liverpool 1w 1l inzaghis inter 1l  1', 'benitez has the upper hand for winning once but i dont see the  at the same level of the three mentioned above', 'mbappe has gotten more ppl fired than trump sheesh', 'ive always felt that madrid were so good individually and at the basics that they could just outplay everyone all over the pitch and that would result in them winning', 'i dont think carlo imposes himself tactically on the team in the way that pep would and honestly i think he might be a better manager for it', 'hes definitely top 3', 'i dont understand much about football  what is it that ancelotti does that makes him so great', 'i understand sort of sit deep and counter attack football presumably as you know you cant win in the midfield so thats your best option but i dont understand top level football strategies', 'guardiola sacchi michels cruyff trapattoni mourinho lippi ancelotti\\n\\ndon carlo shall live forever in the heart of real madrid fans but in 20 years i dont think anyone would be trying to play like any of his teams', 'personally i believe what qualifies for greatness is when people want to build on your ideas long after you exit the stage', 'ancelotti was good at doing only minimal coaching and let his players keep maximum freedom', 'this kind of approach only works in madrid and maybe 12 other teams each season though', 'even at psg and bayern he failed with that approach', 'when i think about the cl winners of the last decade i think about tuchel klopp guardiola flick', 'but i dont think about ancelotti even though he won it two times in three years', 'at real it were the players who made the difference like vinci jr last year or benzema in 2022\\n\\n\\ntldr i think coaches like klopp or guardiola can make any club better even if they happened to join some mid tier club', 'ancelotti only works at real or clubs with a similar roster', 'i dont understand the narrative where you take a coach or a player and put them in a category in a specific tournament', 'why dont we judge a trainer or a player on their overall performance', 'are you the best trainer in the world if you can only win 12 matches a season just because those 12 are in the champions league and you suck ass in the league or domestic cup', 'im not claiming ancelotti do that just wondering why being inconsistent over a whole season can be a good thing', '6 league titles in more than 25 years as coach primarily for top clubs clubs with history of winning each year like psg and bayern in each country tells a story about being inconsistent', 'hes obviously won the most titles \\nbut if you take a closer look at the titles won  the kind of games he won with madrid to win the trophy feel more like luck than tactical', 'also his stint at everton showed that hes not a great manager if hes not managing prime madrid or milan ', 'not taking anything away from him but i wouldnt consider him the all time best ', 'pues te has contestado solo para ganar 5 champions ha necesitado 5 dcadas', 'por ejemplo guardiola no ha necesitado ni dos dcadas para ganar 3 champions con dos equipos', 'y luego tienes a zinedine\\xa0zidane\\xa0se convirti en el primer y nico entrenador en ganar tres ttulos consecutivos', '5 \\n\\nyou can put southgate or rooney in 1314 2122 and 2324 madrid and theyll win it regardless', 'doesnt make his achievement at milan less impressive but star power is real', 'god i can feel the desperation of those whackcelona cucks wanting to talk about their wannabe best trainer off all time fraudiola ', 'in terms of trophy cabinet hes clear of the rest so its hard to argue against him at 1 but i feel like he lacks an unique philosophy', 'he doesnt have a playstyle that is synonymous for carlo ancelotti', 'other atg managers like pep fergie mourinho klopp zidane etc', 'all are recognizable through their tactics but ancelotti isnt', 'people who know his game better please enlighten me but i feel like despite the recent success he had with rma he has regressed since the late 2000s\\n\\nsomeone with a trophy cabinet like his should be regarded higher than he is\\n\\neveryone quick to downvote but no one can even explain his tactics from his current rma run lol', 'itt madristas who will

              "'\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you\\'ll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn\\'t dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn\\'t mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn\\'t say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who\\'ll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who\\'ll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\",positive\\n'"

This involves taking a random sample of equal size from the 'Books', 'Movies', and 'Sports' datasets. These equal-sized samples are then concatenated to form a unified, balanced dataset. Finally, this combined dataset is randomly shuffled and partitioned into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split, ensuring that the distribution of topics is maintained proportionally in both sets through stratified splitting. This approach ensures that the model is not biased towards topics with larger initial datasets and that evaluation is performed on a representative sample of each category.\n",

### About The Project

This project focuses on **sentiment analysis**, a natural language processing (NLP) task aimed at determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. It demonstrates the process of analyzing textual data to classify opinions expressed in a document as positive, negative, or neutral. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the application of machine learning models, notably Support Vector Machines (SVM), for sentiment classification.

The goal is to provide a clear and runnable example of how to build a sentiment analysis classifier, which can be extended or adapted for various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, or brand reputation management.

#### Built With

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas (for data manipulation)
* Scikit-learn (for machine learning models, including SVM, and evaluation metrics)
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing)

### Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You'll also need `pip` for package installation.

* Python 3.x
* pip

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_sentiment_project.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_sentiment_project.git)
    cd your_sentiment_project
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    *If you have a `requirements.txt` file, use:*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Otherwise, install manually:*
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy jupyter nltk
    ```
4.  **Download NLTK data:**
    Open a Python interpreter or a Jupyter Notebook cell and run:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    ```
    *(You might need other NLTK datasets depending on the specific preprocessing steps in the notebooks.)*

### Usage

The core of this project is demonstrated within the Jupyter Notebooks.

1.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  **Open the notebooks:**
    * `SentimentCodeHasan.ipynb`: This notebook likely contains the main sentiment analysis workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
    * `Setimental analysis-SVM.ipynb`: This notebook specifically focuses on implementing and evaluating a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for sentiment classification.

Follow the instructions and code cells within the notebooks to run the sentiment analysis experiments. You can modify the code to experiment with different models, features, or datasets.

### Datasets

The project utilizes the following datasets (included in the repository):

 The dataset(`sentiment_data.csv`) used in this study is the "Financial Sentiment Analysis" dataset, containing over 5,800 entries. 
 Each entry consists of two features: text expressing opinions related to financial topics and the corresponding sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral). 
 The training data is highly imbalanced: neutral ~53%, positive ~31%, and negative ~14%. 
 The test dataset contains 18 text samples labeled with the same three sentiment classes, where all classes are evenly balanced.
